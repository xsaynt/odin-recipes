			<h3><em>Description</em></h3>
			<p>
				Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It
				is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made
				from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.
				After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and
				placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local
				traditions.
